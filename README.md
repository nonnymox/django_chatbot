# django_chatbot
A Django Rule-Based Chatbot is a web application that interacts with users by responding to their queries based on a predefined set of rules. Unlike AI-powered chatbots that use machine learning or natural language processing (NLP), this chatbot operates on a structured set of conditions to generate accurate and relevant responses.

## Key Features:
### Predefined Rules & Responses – The chatbot follows a structured decision tree, where each user input is matched with predefined responses.
### Pattern Matching – Uses simple string matching or regular expressions to understand user queries and return appropriate responses.
### Django Backend – Manages chatbot logic, response rules, and user interactions efficiently.
### Database Integration (Optional) – Stores frequently asked questions (FAQs) and predefined responses in a database for easy updates.
### User Interface – Provides a clean and interactive UI using Django templates, JavaScript, or a frontend framework like React.
API Support (Optional) – Can expose chatbot functionality via a REST API for integration with other platforms.
Session-Based Conversations – Maintains user context within a session to provide a smoother conversation flow.
## How It Works:
User Input: The user types a message into the chatbot.
Pattern Matching: The chatbot checks the input against predefined rules (e.g., keywords, regex, or exact matches).
Response Selection: If a match is found, the corresponding response is sent back. If no match exists, a default response (e.g., "I'm sorry, I don't understand.") is returned.
Display Response: The chatbot displays the response in the chat window.

## Example Rule-Based Response:
User: "Hey"
Chatbot: "Hello
Chatbot: "Django was created by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison in 2005."
## Use Cases:
Customer Support: Handles FAQs and common queries.
Education: Provides automated responses for learning platforms.
Internal Assistance: Acts as a virtual assistant for employees.
